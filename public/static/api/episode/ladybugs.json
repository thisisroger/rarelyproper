He played a major role in creating The Comedians of Comedy tour and subsequent DVDs and television show. He has four albums, two of which reached the top of the Billboard Comedy chart. His television and film appearances are too numerous to list, but I’d be remiss not to credit him as the voice of Remy the rat from Ratatouille.",
