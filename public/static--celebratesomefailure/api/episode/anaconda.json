If you’re not into collaborative comedy, you should check out I Am a Wonderful Man, his stand-up album. If you are a small child, you should probably find a more appropriate website, but first get his book Chicken Cheeks. If you’re a podcast fan check out his podcast Mike and Tom Eat Snacks, or MATES.",
