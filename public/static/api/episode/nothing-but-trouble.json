We discuss the baffling set up to the drastically different second half of the movie, if the 2 large greasy men in diapers are indeed humans, and why Digital Underground would choose to take the detour into the run-down village of Valkenvania. We also talk about how John Candy looked depressed to be in this movie, Dan Aykroyd’s obsession with gadgets, and the fact that there are no jokes in this movie.",
