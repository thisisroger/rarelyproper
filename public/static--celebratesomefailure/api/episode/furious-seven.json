They discuss why the incredible feats these drag racers accomplish must make them superheroes, Tyrese & Ludacris absolutely killing it as the comic-relief, Han’s long emotional journey, the larger than life body of The Rock, and the jaw-dropping post-credits scene that made Adam Scott declare that director Justin Lin must be a fan of How Did This Get Made. Plus, everyone names their favorite character and explain why.",
