Tompkins joins the gang to discuss this kid's movie and its many flaws: The unnecessarily complicated language, the blatant animal abuse, the awkward casting of Tim Gunn, even the terrible trailers are up for judgment. We introduce the first ever Second Opinions segment, and as always close it up with You've Got Mail. If you've got a child's heart, or had to drag your children to see this movie, you'll enjoy this episode!",
