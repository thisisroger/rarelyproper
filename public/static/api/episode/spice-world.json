Parks and Rec’s Retta joins us to try to make sense of the movie’s nonsense such as; the gigantic interior of the bus, the pregnant Asian friend, and why Ginger Spice kisses an alien on the mouth. We’ll also get into the Italian men asses scene, why Retta had a dream about George Wendt, and the possibility of a character contemplating suicide. That’s not all, tune in to find who Paul, June, Jason, and Retta would be if they were Spice Girls. Girl Power, bro!",
