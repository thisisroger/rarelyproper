If you can find it in yourself to forgive him, you’ll find that he’s a talented comedian, actor and (perhaps not surprisingly) rapper. His role as Brett in Eagleheart is pretty great, but not nearly as great as his one-man show One Thousand Cats. If you have any more questions, consult the internet which is teeming with Brett’s comedy.",
