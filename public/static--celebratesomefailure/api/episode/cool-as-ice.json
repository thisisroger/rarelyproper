We watched it and invited Brian Huskey to join us in reveling in this relic of the early 90s. Weird biker gangs, inexplicable love stories, and the Witness Protection Program flesh out what is essentially a feature-length hip hop music video starring Vanilla Ice. What does Vanilla think of the movie? Learn as Rob Van Winkle joins the crew for the final few minutes to give insight into the stunts, the sets, and the jargon that has stood the test of time.",
