John Gemberling joins Paul, June, and Jason to figure out who is a native of Shadaloo, why Jean-Claude Van Damme pretends to be dead for a really long time, and what the hell was the reason for Van Damme to play a home video tape while driving a boat. They’ll also share their favorite lines, explore all the shoehorned elements of the video game, and explain to June what “street fighting” really means.",
