You might have even seen him on Comedy Central’s Hot List or his very own Comedy Central Presents. You could have seen his web videos with Front Page Films. You’ve probably listed to his Nerdist podcast, You Made it Weird. I think, and I could be wrong, that when you look up “funny” in the dictionary you’ll see his picture. Oh wait, I just checked, and I was wrong. Don’t let that deter you though, he’s hilarious.",

We're more than happy to invite Pete into our 'most secure' files area. Hooah!",
