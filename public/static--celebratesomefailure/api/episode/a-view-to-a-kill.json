For starters, he’s a creator of the Superego, I Was There Too, James Bonding, Pistol Shrimps Radio, and Complete Man podcasts. There are more but let’s stop talking about podcasts. He’s also been seen or heard on Community, Adventure Time, Blindspot, Comedy Bang! Bang!, Another Period, and has been featured on Comedy Central’s Drunk History, slurring his way through thoughtful retellings of Watergate, the Alamo, and the life of Wernher von Braun. He’s also the current spokesperson for Volkswagen. By day, Matt is a professor who teaches acting and improv at a couple of local colleges where he will most likely give you an easy A.",
