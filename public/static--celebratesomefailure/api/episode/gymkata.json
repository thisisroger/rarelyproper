They’ll get into the Kurt Thomas flipping as he talks to himself scene, the questionable effectiveness of arrows in the film, flag ninjas, the village of the crazies, and the infamous pommel horse scene. Plus, audience questions make us wonder how the director of Enter The Dragon went from working with Bruce Lee to Kurt Thomas.",
