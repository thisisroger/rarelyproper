His time at Saturday Night Live has brought us such joyful performances as the character Anthony Crispino and the best Snooki impression the world has ever seen.",

We discuss everything from the weird father/son relationship to the movie basically becoming a high stakes arm wrestling documentary. We also talk about the possibility of  Stalloneâ€™s wife being insane, product placement in the form of Alka-Seltzer, and why being able to drive a truck makes you smart.",
