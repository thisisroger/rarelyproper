He teaches improv at The Groundlings, rocks out in the band The Discount Cruise to Hell, and plays one of the world’s most beloved fantastical creatures in Planet Unicorn. If you google Chloe Sevigny, one of the first results is one of Drew’s videos gently teasing the fashion-designer-actress-model-weirdo. Listen to Glitter in the Garbage each Thursday on Earwolf!",
