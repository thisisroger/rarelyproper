They’ll cover everything from small town dreams in the big city, Brandy & Kim Kardashian’s roles, Vanessa Williams’ French accent, and how everyone has (spoiler alert) AIDS. Plus, we hear from Vanessa Williams on her French accent, Tyler Perry’s thoughts on the movie, and this episode breaks a HDTGM record for the most 5 Star Reviews during 2nd Opinions.",
