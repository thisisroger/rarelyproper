Fortunately we found someone just as excited about the movies to chat with us: Brian Taylor, the co-writer/director of the franchise. He joins Paul and Jason to tell us about Bai Ling's improvising, Jason Statham's secret comedic prowess, and what that mysterious underwear stain really was. As if that wasn't enough, he brings us the inside scoop from working with Nic Cage. We are proud to welcome Brian this week for latest HDTGM Director's Edition!",
