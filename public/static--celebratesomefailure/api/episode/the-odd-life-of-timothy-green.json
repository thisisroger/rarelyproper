Together they’ve created inspirational works such as Tom Goes to the Mayor and Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! He made audiences weep with his performance in Bridesmaids and brought the world the war-ending series Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule. I think he might be the president of the world.",

We talk about Timothy’s relationship with Baby Mila Kunis, the Titanic portrait drawing scene, and Common sizing up kids to be on a soccer team.
