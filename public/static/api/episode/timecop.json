His characters , be they Bobby Bottleservice, Fabrice Fabrice, or Randy Moss’ Dog, are forever welcome on our shows. He’s a quick improviser and hilarious stand-up, and you can watch his special Thank You Very Cool or the semi-improvised The League for verification on that. His credits are unending, and incredibly impressive. So, like no offense none taken, we love him.",
