Tompkins join Paul & Jason at Largo in Los Angeles to talk all about how Lake Placid shows that nature and man cannot co-exist. They’ll cover everything from the movie not reaching 90 minutes yet feeling long, the amazing performances by the cows, Brendan Gleeson reading the stage directions, underwater bears, and more.
