        "episodeDescription": "Fast Five might be a critical success, a million dollar blockbuster, and an 'event in cinema' (Vin's words, not ours) but that doesn't make it immune to criticism. Paul, June, Jason, and Adam Scott discuss the inexplicably magical jewelry, unnecessary characters, and chronological confusion that lay beneath an otherwise incredible action flick. If you haven't seen Fast Five yet, stay until the very end for a surprise celebrity cameo (no, not Perd Hapley).",
