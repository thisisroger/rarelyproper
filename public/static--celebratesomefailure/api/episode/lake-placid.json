Tompkins join Paul & Jason at Largo in Los Angeles to talk all about how Lake Placid shows that nature and man cannot co-exist. They’ll cover everything from the movie not reaching 90 minutes yet feeling long, the amazing performances by the cows, Brendan Gleeson reading the stage directions, underwater bears, and more. Plus, we finally get down to the bottom of what the proper way to say Reese’s Pieces is before getting into audience Q&As!",
