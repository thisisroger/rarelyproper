Plus he’s got a rad podcast called The Jeff Rubin Jeff Rubin Show where he discusses cool nerd stuff like Legends of the Hidden Temple (awesome) and porno parodies of popular TV shows (even awesomer). So yeah, file him under “Great” (why do you have a file cabinet of Earwolf guests?).",

They talk about why you shouldn’t judge the movie from the poster, the many similarities to Adventures in Babysitting, the heavy secrets montage, and the very dark ending.",
