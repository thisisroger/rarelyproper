If so, Paul, Jason, June, and Rob Huebel are the smartest, most able-minded people ever to sit down and suffer through it. If you share Jason’s rage at the inconsistency of this film or Rob’s anger at the extreme un-sexiness of the characters, than you must join us for this celebration of awfulness.",
