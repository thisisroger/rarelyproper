Special guest Scott Aukerman returns for a very special episode of How Did This Get Made? about Sharknado 2: The Second One. From the “homages” to other various movies, to whether a shark bit off Tara’s whole arm or just her hand, to Al Roker & Matt Lauer having huge roles in the movie, to the Statue of Liberty’s head becoming the boulder from Indiana Jones, to all the cameos which include Jared the Subway guy & Biz Markie, to “Frogger.” We cover it all! Plus, Paul & June’s baby makes his podcast debut! Chompa. Chompa. Chompa.",
