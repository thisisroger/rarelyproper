        "episodeDescription": "How do you make a movie like Mac and Me? We'll give you the recipe: Take a bag of Skittles. Mix it with equal parts tired 80's archetypes and bad CGI. Let it simmer in Coca-Cola while you go have an impromptu yet totally choreographed dance party. Carefully remove any traces of plot and serve with a side of french fries. There you have it, a recipe for a movie so stomach-churning that even the talented How Did This Get Made chefs, including Adam Pally, cannot make palatable. Enjoy!",
