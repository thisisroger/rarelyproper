It takes a special kind of movie with a strange choice of casting, tone, and plot for us to truly ask “how did this get made?” And this movie delivers. We get into everything from LL Cool J’s interrogation scene to the big reveal of Joan Cusack’s character. Oh yeah, we didn’t forget about the sea monster.",
