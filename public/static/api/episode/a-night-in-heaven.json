The point is: I don’t know where you know her from, dawg. She’s also in a band called Four Lost Souls, and, this is exciting for you because now you can say you know at least one black person in the alt-country scene. They recorded their 2016 album in Muscle Shoals, AL and she once called Robert Plant “Dad” to his face on Fathers’ Day. He didn’t love it.",
