Jonah Ray is in the studio to deconstruct and celebrate the ridiculousness of this Neil Labute remake disaster. We also get a call from Liam O'Donnell, one of the writers of Skyline, who defends his movie and offers up an explanation of how it got made. In case that isn't enough, we've got a special tease into our next episode which you can expect earlier than normal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a special ceremony to attend.",
