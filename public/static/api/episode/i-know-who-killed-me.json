He’s been in just about everything that’s hip and cool and funny. The Ten, Reno 911, The Sarah Silverman Program, Ken’s been on all of them! He even made his own movie starring Paul Rudd called Diggers. To quote his most beloved character Louie: “I wanna dip my balls in it!”",

Is this the worst movie Lindsay Lohan has ever been in or flat out the worst movie ever? These are just a few of the questions I Know Who Killed Me left us with.
