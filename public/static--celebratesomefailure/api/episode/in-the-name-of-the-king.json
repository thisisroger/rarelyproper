We talk about how Jason Statham’s character could care less about the death of his son, Matthew Lillard’s use of his ren fair experience, and plastic Burt Reynolds. Jason & June recreate one of the romantic scenes, Seth explains how Ray Liotta has cocaine eyes, and Paul had a tough time finding 5 star Amazon reviews. Jump out of that tree and take a listen!",
