We learn about incest, how much salt to add to boiling water, and, most importantly, to be cautious of water snakes.  Also, we discuss the performance of Robert Earl Jones (father to James Earl Jones) and Paul's understanding of the AIDS epidemic. Enjoy this not-so-low-budget ode to side pony-tails and short shorts.",
