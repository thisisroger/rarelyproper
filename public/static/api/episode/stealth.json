Everyone who grew to love him as a UCB sketch performer and improviser now has the chance to see him on television in MTV’s Death Valley. Not enough? Well, he’s writing on the new Comedy Central show Key and Peele. But wait, you still want to see him live? Well head to the UCB in Los Angeles on a Sunday night and you can see him in Shitty Jobs, the handsomest improv show I’ve ever seen!",
